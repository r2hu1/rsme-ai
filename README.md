## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 20 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or a compatible package manager

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

You will need a Google AI API key to use the generative AI features.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
2.  Add your API key to the `.env` file:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
    ```
    You can obtain a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Servers

This project requires two development servers to be running simultaneously: one for the Next.js frontend and another for the Genkit AI flows.

- **Start the Next.js server:**
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  Your application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

- **In a separate terminal, start the Genkit server:**
  ```bash
  npm run genkit:watch
  ```
  This command starts the Genkit flows and watches for any changes you make to the AI logic.

You can now open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002` to use the application.
