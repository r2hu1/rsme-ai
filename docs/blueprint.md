## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL hue 210, saturation 86%, lightness 53%, corresponding to hex code #1A82E2. The bright saturated blue aligns well with the app's purpose by evoking professionalism, capability and innovation. To ensure it contrasts well with the background in the light scheme, the brightness has been increased.
- Background color: HSL hue 210, saturation 20%, lightness 96%, corresponding to hex code #F0F6FA. The background is lightly desaturated hue, matching the blue.
- Accent color: HSL hue 180, saturation 55%, lightness 46%, corresponding to hex code #3CB7B7. It is an analogous color (shifted 30 degrees on the color wheel), and offers great separation in both brightness and saturation to stand out for key UI elements like buttons or highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern and neutral feel.
- Use clean and professional icons to represent resume sections and actions.
- Design a clean and structured layout that effectively organizes resume information.
- Incorporate subtle animations or transitions for user interactions, such as loading or displaying test results.
